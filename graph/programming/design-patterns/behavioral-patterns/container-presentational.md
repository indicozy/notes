Let's say we want to create an application that fetches 6 dog images, and renders these images on the screen. Ideally, we want to enforce separation of concerns by separating this process into two parts:
1. Presentational Components: Components that care about how data is shown to the user. In this example, that's the rendering the list of dog images.
2. Container Components: Components that care about what data is shown to the user. In this example, that's fetching the dog images.
