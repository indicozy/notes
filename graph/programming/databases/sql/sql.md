# SQL
SQL is a language used for communicating with RDBMS which support SQL. Examples are:
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- PostgreSQL
Databases do not necessarily follow table pattern of the SQL language. They can use other data structure, such as documents in CockroachDB which is nearly 100% adaptable to PostgreSQL, to be used in cases which classic SQL database is lacking, such as multi-node cluster deployment.
