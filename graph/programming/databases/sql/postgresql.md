# PostgreSQL
Postgresql is an Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS) based on [[graph/programming/databases/sql/postgres|Postgres]] standard Version 4.2.

It supports:
- complex queries
- foreign keys
- triggers
- updatable views
- transactional integrity
- multiversion concurrency control

Also, PostgreSQL can be extended by the user in many ways, for example by adding new:
- data types
 - functions
- operators
 - aggregate functions
- index methods
- procedural languages

# History of PostgreSQL
The POSTGRES project, led by Professor Michael Stonebraker, was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Research Office (ARO), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and ESL, Inc. 
POSTGRES has undergone several major releases since then. The first “demoware” system became operational in 1987 and was shown at the 1988 ACM-SIGMOD Conference.
