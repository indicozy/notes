# Model-View-Controller (MVC)
![[attachments/Pasted image 20231101163559.png]]
MVC is the most popular and widely used architecture in iOS development. In this architecture, the application is divided into three distinct components:

- Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- View: Represents the user interface and user experience of the application.
- Controller: Sits between the Model and View, acts as an intermediary, and handles the logic of the application.

As the application grows, MVC can lead to a massive View and bloated Controller, making it hard to maintain and test.
