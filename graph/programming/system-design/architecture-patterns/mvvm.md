## MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
![[attachments/Pasted image 20231101163612.png]]
MVVM is another architecture that separates the presentation logic from the View. In this architecture, the ViewModel is responsible for presenting the data to the View. It acts as an intermediary between the View and Model, and it also handles the userâ€™s input.

The ViewModel exposes the data to the View through data bindings. When the data in the ViewModel changes, it automatically updates the View. Similarly, when the user interacts with the View, the ViewModel updates the Model.
