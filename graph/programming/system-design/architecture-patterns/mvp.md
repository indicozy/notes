# Model-View-Presenter (MVP)
![[attachments/Pasted image 20231101163605.png]]
MVP is an alternative to MVC that separates the presentation logic from the View. In this architecture, the Presenter handles the communication between the Model and View. The Model remains unchanged, and the Presenter manipulates the Viewâ€™s data to present it to the user.

MVP is a good choice for applications where the View contains a lot of business logic or the business logic is complex. By separating the presentation logic, MVP helps keep the View and Model simple and easy to maintain.
