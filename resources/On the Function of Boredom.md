# Summary
Boredom is desire for changing the current goal to a new, more interesting goal.
| Boredom is the emotional indication to pursue an alternative goal.

Apathy results from recognition of complete failure or helplessness and is characterized by a lack of motivation and a failure to seek alternatives.

Importantly, we propose that boredom results from diminishing emotional stimulation in a situation and prompts responses to facilitate the pursuit of alternative goals.
